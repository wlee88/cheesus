# üßÄ Cheesus

Welcome! Cheesus is simple CRUD app for showing available cheeses that we have in our physical store. Who knows - maybe we'll accept and extend to payments.

## üìã Still Todo before we can consider production ready
- Authentication
- Metrics capture (Cloudwatch logs could do for now if we deploy via AWS)
- Actual deployment and code (terraform/pulumi/CloudFormation) - we have a healthcheck we can use to check. 
- CDN setup/Load Balancing/Route53 domain setup
